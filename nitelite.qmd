# User Guide for This Template

**DO NOT submit papers containing LaTeX error messages.** If you see any error messages, please fix them before submission.

## Title

The title should be in Title Case. Keep it concise and informative, ideally within 12 words. Avoid abbreviations in the title unless they are widely recognized.

## References

Add your bibliography entries to `bibliography.bib` and cite them using standard Quarto citation syntax. Here is an example citation on diamond open access [@fuchs2013diamond]. Since many of you are using the OpenSky data, here is another example [@schafer2014bringing].

## Footnotes

Use footnotes sparingly. They should be used for additional information that is not essential to the main text.^[This is an example footnote that works.]

## Tables

Use standard markdown tables or Quarto's table syntax. @tbl-example shows an example.

| **Parameter** | **Notation** | **Remarks** |
|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| name | - | engine common identifier |
| manufacture | - | name of the manufacturer |
| bpr | $\lambda$ | bypass ratio |
| pr | - | pressure ratio |
| thrust | $T_0$ | maximum static thrust |

: Example table {#tbl-example}

## Figures

Use standard Quarto figure syntax with `![caption](path){#fig-id width=X%}`. Place images in a `figures/` folder.

## Equations

Use standard LaTeX equation syntax. @eq-cauchy shows an example equation.

$$
\rho\frac{\mathrm{D} \mathbf{u}}{\mathrm{D} t} = - \nabla p + \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol \tau + \rho\,\mathbf{g}
$$ {#eq-cauchy}
