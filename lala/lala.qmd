## Intro
Utilizing the advantage of granularity by nighttime lights data to capture economic activity at lower spatial level, this study extends the analysis to the provincial level to gain insights from cross-sectional heterogeneity. To generate a comparable analysis with the official province GDP data disseminated by BPS, the nighttime lights data format are also compiled on a quarterly year-on-year basis for 34 provinces in Indonesia spanning the period 2014Q1 to 2024Q4. Later on the analysis, to assess whether the relationship between provincial GDP and nighttime lights changed during and after the pandemic period, we extend the baseline specification by including dummy variables for the Covid-19 period and the post-pandemic period or the scarring effect.

## Exploratory
In the previous section (see: Fig. 1), it is seen that Java exhibits a stark contrast compared to the rest of Indonesia. This scatterplot (Fig. L1), clarifies that Java has higher nighttime light intensity. In addition, it also displays that Java relatively has higher provincial GDP compared to other island groups. The data points for Java in blue color are clustered toward the higher end of both axes, indicating higher levels of economic activity and luminosity relative to other regions.  Conversely, though the linear trend between nighttime light and provincial GDP are still visible, provinces outside Java show greater dispersion. This implying more variation in the relationship between light intensity and GDP possibly due to differences in economic structure or spatial distribution of economic activities. In regions outside Java, the economic structure is dominated by agriculture, plantation activities, and mining industries. While these sectors contribute significantly to regional output, they produce comparatively low levels of nighttime lights.

## Regression
As the baseline, we estimate the correlation between nighttime lights (NTL) and regional GDP using a pooled Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model, which captures the overall association between the variables. To extend the analysis, we employ a fixed-effects (FE) model to control for time-invariant provincial characteristics, and a two-way fixed-effects (TWFE) model that advanced the FE estimation by incorporating year fixed effects to account for common shocks affecting all provinces simultaneously.

The regression results show a strong and significant relationship at the 1% level between regional GDP and night-time light intensity across all model specifications. Coefficients from the OLS and fixed-effects models range between 0.97 and 1.3, and remain positive and stable even after controlling for COVID-19 and post-pandemic scarring effects. In the TWFE model, the COVID-19 dummy indicates negative impacts during 2020–2021, and the scarring control also suggests the same negative correlation for 2022. Year-specific dummies indicate that, despite the deviations observed during the COVID-19 and post-pandemic periods, the overall elasticity pattern between regional GDP and nighttime light intensity remains consistent over time.

## Conclusion
Unlike the previous national-level nighttime lights model, which found no positive or significant relationship between the nighttime light data and GDP, the provincial cross-sectional analysis reveals a different pattern. At the regional level, nighttime light intensity shows a strong and statistically significant correlation with GDP across various model specifications, including OLS, FE, and TWFE. The relationship also remains consistent even after controlling for the COVID-19 and post-pandemic scarring periods.
