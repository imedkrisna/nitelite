## \## Discussion

With an update to the nighttime lights data featuring a new collection of data (collection 5200),

both the ARDL and VECM models were able to be trained on data up to the period of September 2025.

The data update has particularly significant ramifications for the ARDL model, as ARDL models are

unable to forecast multiple steps ahead.

An ARDL model is built upon the following equation:

\$\$

y_t = \\alpha

\+ \\sum\_{i=1}\^{p} \\beta_i y\_{t-i}

\+ \\sum\_{j=0}\^{q} \\gamma_j x\_{t-j}

\+ \\varepsilon_t

\$\$

This equation contains lagged values of both the dependent variable (\$y_t\$)

and the independent variables (\$x_t\$). The incorporation of these lagged variables

means that while ARDL models can forecast one period ahead very easily,

forecasting multiple steps ahead is not feasible unless future paths of the independent variables are provided.

The following table presents a comparison of ARDL and VECM models across multiple scenarios.

It can be seen that the ARDL model outperforms the VECM model across every scenario. Consistent with the results of figure 11, the ARDL model with scarring performs the best.

\# Conclusion

Overall, the ARDL model is the best performing model across all scenarios, which is evident from the high accuracy of the model coupled with the significance of the nighttime lights index. The significance of the nighttime lights index means that the variable is strongly influencing the success of the model, and that the low rate of error is not simply because the model is drawing upon past GDP values. However, it must be said that the usage of the ARDL model is contingent on the availability of recent data. The ARDL model performs best when used for nowcasting and short-term forecasting. The results of the analysis of nighttime lights as a sole predictor for GDP have been promising, but it is possible that model results could be improved by adding new independent variables. Other options for modeling going forward include experimenting with a Dynamic Factor Model (DFM), which would incorporate nighttime lights along with many other leading economic indicators with the objective of nowcasting GDP.
