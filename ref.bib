   abstract = {Night lights, as detected by satellites, are increasingly used by economists, typically as a proxy for economic activity. The growing popularity of these data reflects either the absence, or the presumed inaccuracy, of more conventional economic statistics, like national or regional GDP. Further growth in use of night lights is likely, as they have been included in the AidData geoquery tool for providing subnational data, and in geographic data that the Demographic and Health Survey links to anonymized survey enumeration areas. Yet, this ease of obtaining night lights data may lead to inappropriate use, if users fail to recognize that most of the satellites providing these data were not designed to assist economists, and have features that may threaten validity of analyses based on these data, especially for temporal comparisons, and for small and rural areas. In this paper, we review sources of satellite data on night lights, discuss issues with these data, and survey some of their uses in economics.},

   abstract = {In panel data four procedures are widely used: pooling, aggregating, averaging group estimates, and cross-section regression. In the static case, if the coefficients differ randomly, all four procedures give unbiased estimates of coefficient means. In the dynamic case, when the coefficients differ across groups, pooling and aggregating give inconsistent and potentially highly misleading estimates of the coefficients, though the cross-section can provide consistent estimates of the long-run effects. The theoretical results on the properties of the four procedures are illustrated by UK labour demand functions for 38 industries over 30 years.},

 abstract = {We develop a statistical framework to use satellite data on night lights to augment official income growth measures. For countries with poor national income accounts, the optimal estimate of growth is a composite with roughly equal weights on conventionally measured growth and growth predicted from lights. Our estimates differ from official data by up to three percentage points annually. Using lights, empirical analyses of growth need no longer use countries as the unit of analysis; we can measure growth for sub- and supranational regions. We show, for example, that coastal areas in sub-Saharan Africa are growing slower than the hinterland.},

   abstract = {Economists face method selection problem while working with time series data. As time series data may possess specific properties such as trend and structural break, common methods used to analyze other types of data may not be appropriate for the analysis of time series data. This paper discusses the properties of time series data, compares common data analysis methods and presents a methodological framework for time series data analysis. The framework greatly helps in choosing appropriate test methods. To present an example, Nepal's money–price relationship is examined. Test results obtained following this methodological framework are found to be more robust and reliable.},

   abstract = {Based on evidence from national data, Henderson et al. (Am Econ Rev 102(2):994-1028, 2012 ) suggest that growth of night lights can proxy reliably for growth of regional GDP in low-income countries where GDP data is frequently lacking or of poor quality. Using regional data in two large emerging economies, Brazil and India, this paper finds, however, that the relationship between night lights growth and observed GDP growth varies significantly--in both statistical and economic terms--across regions. The same applies to advanced economies like the United States and Western Europe. The paper accounts for measurement issues with regard to the night lights data and considers several extensions of the empirical model in order to analyze if and under which circumstances the relationship between night lights and GDP growth is stable. Yet parameter instability typically persists, while the stable relationship among urban counties in Brazil represents the major exception.},

I show that the night-time-light elasticity of GDP is larger in authoritarian regimes, even accounting for differences in multiple country characteristics. This autocracy gradient in the elasticity is greater when the incentive to exaggerate economic growth is stronger or when the constraints on exaggeration are weaker. The results suggest that autocracies overstate yearly GDP growth by approximately 35%. Adjusting the data for manipulation leads to a more nuanced view on the recent economic success of autocracies.},
